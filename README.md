## üõ†Ô∏è What I Did

This project was implemented as part of my learning journey with Spring Security. I followed the tutorial closely and:

- Recreated the project from scratch in my local environment.
- Set up an OAuth2 Authorization Server using Spring Security 6 and the Spring Authorization Server project.
- It demonstrates key concepts such as:
    - OAuth2 Authorization Code flow
    - OpenID Connect (OIDC)
    - In-memory user and client registration
    - RSA key generation for JWT signing
